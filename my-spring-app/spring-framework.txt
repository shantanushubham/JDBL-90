Spring is a lightweight, open-source Java framework used to build enterprise-level applications.
Its core idea is to make Java development simpler, modular, testable, and loosely coupled.

Before Sping, there were a few problems:
- Heavy tight coupling between classes
- Hard-to-test code
- Heavy frameworks like EJB was used

Spring solves this by:
- Managing objects (beans) for you
- Injecting dependencies automatically
- Providing infrastructure features like:
    * Transaction Management
    * Security
    * MVC
    * Data Access (JDBC, JPA, Hibernate)

Inversion of Control (IoC):
It means: "You don't create and manage your dependencies - the framework does it for you."

Normally, you control object creation and you decide when and how dependencies are wired.
With IoC, a container/framewrok manages object creation, lifecycle and wiring.

Dependency Injection (DI):
DI is a design pattern used to implement IoC.
    - Dependencies are provided (injected) from outside rather than created inside the class.

    So:
        IoC = Principle (what)
        DI = Technique (how)

Bean
It is an object of a class. In Spring, a bean is simply an object that Spring creates
and manages for you. You don't create the object.

Bean Lifecycle and Scopes
It means the steps that a bean goes through from creation to destruction.

1. Bean is created
    Spring creates a bean using
        * constructor
        * factory method

2. Dependencies are injected (autowiring)
    Spring injects required dependencies.

3. Initialisation callbacks
    You can look into this phase into 3 ways:
    - @PostConstruct
    - InitializingBean (after properties are set)
    - @Bean(initMethod = "init")

4. Bean is ready to use
    Bean is now fully ready to be used by the application

5. Destruction callbacks (when app shuts down)
    You can look into this phase into 3 ways:
    - @PreDestory
    - DisposableBean (destroy)
    - @Bean(destroyMethod = "cleanup")

Advantages of Spring Boot over Traditional Spring
Spring Boot is a framework built on top of Spring that simplifies application development.
It does that by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers and prod-ready features.

    Traditional Spring                      Spring Boot
1. XML heavy config                     Annotation based
2. Manual setup                         Auto-configuration
3. External Server                      Embedded server
4. Time consuming                       Faster development
5. Complex Packaging                    Simple JAR
